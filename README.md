Utility to convert the ISO 3166-2 country codes used by MaxMind GeoIP to/from
those used by Natural Earth. This can be useful when using GeoIP in conjunction
with maps created using the Natural Earth dataset.

Contains a LibreOffice Calc document used to generate Python and JavaScript
code.

This was created specifically for use with the "map units" downloads from NE. I
have not looked at the "countries" download and whether this would be useful
with it, but would be happy to support that if there were any extra/other
effort required.

Nothing has been done to compensate for entries that don't correspond. They have
been left blank.

If you can improve this or make it more complete I would be happy to take pull
requests.
